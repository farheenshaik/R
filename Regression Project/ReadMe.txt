Regression: Use the Communities and Crime dataset (see link below). Use whatever method you find that gives the best result after you have cleaned the data. Do a simple cross validation using a 75-25 split on the dataset. Your script should do the following:

Read in the dataset
Clean the dataset
Build a model of your choice on the training data
Predict values for the test data
Output a test MSE
NOTES: This dataset has many missing values – many predictors are useless and need to be discarded. The value you are trying to predict is the last variable, ViolentCrimesPerPop. You can experiment with different modeling methods and models, but the script you submit should only contain the final approach you decided to use. Please include comments to make the script readable!
