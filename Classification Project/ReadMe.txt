Classification: Use the Mushrooms dataset for this part of the project, and submit a separate script. Use whatever method you find that gives the best result after you have cleaned the data. Do a simple cross validation using a 75-25 split on the dataset. Your script should do the following:

Read in the dataset
Clean the dataset
Build a model of your choice on the training data
Predict values for the test data
Output a confusion table of the test results
NOTES: This dataset appears to be clean, but all of the predictors are categorical, and some have too many categories and some categories have very small frequencies (counts), so you will need to adjust the levels. The value you are trying to predict is the first variable, p. You can experiment with different modeling methods and models, but the script you submit should only contain the final approach you decided to use. Please include comments to make the script readable!
