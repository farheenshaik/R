# R
#Use the Mushrooms data set for this project. Perform classification using Recursive partitioning and Regression Trees method and a simple #cross validation using a 75-25 split on the data set.
#This data set appears to be clean, but all of the predictors are categorical, and some have too many categories and some categories have #very small frequencies (counts), so the levels need to be adjusted.
